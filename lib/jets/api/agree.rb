        Jets uses precompiled binary gems from the Jets Api service to
        provide a user-friendly developer experience. Jets Api
        rate limits free gem download requests daily. You can upgrade to a paid plan
        for unlimited gem download requests. Open Source projects may also qualify
        for a free unlimited plan. More info:

          https://www.rubyonjets.com/rate-limits

        Reporting gems to Jets Api also allows it to build new gems typically
        within a few minutes. So if you run into missing gems, you can try deploying
        again after a few minutes. Non-reported gems may take several days or longer.
        Jets Api only collects the info it needs to run the service.
